Remove the logic that plays five rounds

Create three buttons, one for each selection
Add a div for displaying the results

Initial logic:
Choose rock, paper, scissors.
Computer randomly chooses one.
Winner assigned.

Let's have:
* headline xx
* three buttons xx
* Round winner announcement xx
* Display running score xx

Next:
* implement test event listeners, think this through
* need to practice event listeners a lot more and using events
* go back through the youtube lessons and everything from the dom notes - practice all until second nature

From TOP:
In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.

Current status:
* playRound logic works! Now build out the rest. Ignore styling for now.
* So, logic to build:
* When button pressed, output to DOM and show it. xx
** Look for p class, if doesn't exist create. then move to update.  xx
* Then do same for computer choice. xx
* Then show winner. xx
* Then update scores.
* Then work out logic for first to five.
* Add JS for confetti for fun if you win or something negative if you lose

Future:
* put all new work into functions

Bugs:
* Fix logic on scores because first round has a score of 0. all about when you declare the variables and how you add them to the dom, straight forward enough.
