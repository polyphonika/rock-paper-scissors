Remove the logic that plays five rounds

Create three buttons, one for each selection
Add a div for displaying the results

Initial logic:
Choose rock, paper, scissors.
Computer randomly chooses one.
Winner assigned.

Let's have:
* headline xx
* three buttons xx
* Round winner announcement xx
* Display running score xx

Next:
* implement test event listeners, think this through
* need to practice event listeners a lot more and using events
* go back through the youtube lessons and everything from the dom notes - practice all until second nature

Current status:
* playRound logic works! Now build out the rest. Ignore styling for now.
